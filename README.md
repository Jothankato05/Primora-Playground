## What is Primora?

**Primora** is a revolutionary, security-first programming language designed for the next generation of developers. It seamlessly integrates:

- **AI-Native Constructs** - Built-in AI operations for prediction, manipulation, and analysis
- **Security-First Design** - Automatic source sanitization and code review
- **Psychological Scripting** - Behavioral influence and persuasion mechanics
- **Python Transpilation** - Easy integration with existing Python ecosystems
- **Natural Language Interface** - Write code in plain English
- **Domain-Specific Extensions** - Perfect for ethical hacking, AI development, and strategic systems

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Programming
```primora
predict threat of network_traffic using ai.model("intrusion_detector")
if threat.is("malicious") {
    manipulate attacker using tactic("decoy", tone="aggressive")
    echo "Threat neutralized" using frame("confident")
}
```

### Natural Language Interface
```primora
# Describe what you want in plain English
search "latest AI breakthroughs" as results
summarize results as summary
echo summary
```

### Universal Commands
```primora
# Built-in utilities for common tasks
weather London
wiki "Albert Einstein"
currency 100 USD to EUR
news "artificial intelligence"
```

### Real-Time Collaboration
```primora
# Share your code instantly with a URL
# Multiple developers can edit simultaneously
# Built-in Firebase integration
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Via pip (Recommended)
```bash
pip install primora-lang
```

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jothankato05/Primora-Playground.git
cd Primora-Playground
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Interactive REPL
```bash
primora
```

#### Run a File
```bash
primora script.pri
```

#### Transpile to Python
```bash
primora-transpile input.pri -o output.py
```

#### Start the Backend Server
```bash
primora-backend
```

#### Language Server (LSP)
```bash
primora-lsp
```

## Examples

### 1. Threat Detection System
```primora
listen source("http://network.scan") as traffic
predict threat of traffic using ai.model("intrusion_detector")

if threat.is("malicious") {
    manipulate attacker using tactic("decoy", tone="aggressive")
    echo "Threat neutralized" using frame("confident")
} else {
    echo "Network secure" using frame("calm")
}
```

### 2. Data Analysis Pipeline
```primora
fetch url("https://api.example.com/data") as dataset
summarize dataset as insights
plot insights as "Data Visualization"
email to "team@company.com" subject "Analysis Complete" body insights
```

### 3. Behavioral Influence
```primora
manipulate user_response using tactic("urgency", tone="persuasive")
if user_response.is("positive") {
    echo "Action completed successfully!"
}
```

## Architecture

Primora consists of several core components:

- **Lexer** (`primora_parser.py`) - Tokenizes Primora code
- **Parser** (`primora_parser.py`) - Builds Abstract Syntax Trees
- **Interpreter** (`primora_interpreter.py`) - Executes Primora programs
- **Transpiler** (`primora_transpiler.py`) - Converts to Python
- **Standard Library** (`primora_stdlib.py`) - Built-in functions and modules
- **LSP Server** (`primora_lsp.py`) - IDE integration
- **Backend API** (`primora_backend.py`) - Web service for playground
- **Natural Language** (`primora_nl.py`) - NL to code conversion
